<p>
The Ensembl human gene annotations have been updated using Ensembl's
automatic annotation pipeline. The updated annotation incorporates new
protein and cDNA sequences which have become publicly available since
the last GRCh37 genebuild (March 2009).

<p>
This archive displays a joint gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation
from Ensembl and a freeze of the manual annotation from Havana (first published in Vega Release 55).
Transcripts from the two annotation sources
are merged if they share the same internal exon-intron boundaries
(i.e. have identical splicing pattern) with slight differences in
the terminal exons allowed. Importantly, all Havana transcripts are included in the final Ensembl/Havana merged (GENCODE) gene set.
See the summary table opposite for the corresponding GENCODE version number. The Consensus
Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the
annotations. More information about the
